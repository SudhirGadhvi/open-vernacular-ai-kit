# Open Vernacular AI Kit

`open-vernacular-ai-kit` is an open-source SDK + CLI for cleaning up Indian vernacular-English
code-mixed text.
This release is India-first and Sarvam-first, with global language/provider support planned via
community PRs in upcoming updates.

Core promise:

- Canonical output format: native-script tokens stay in native script; English stays Latin; romanized
  vernacular text is converted to native script when possible.
- Offline-first by default: optional ML backends and remote model downloads are opt-in.
